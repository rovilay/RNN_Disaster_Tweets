Kaggle competition: [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

In this project, we will build a machine learning model (NLP) that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. This is a binary classification problem and we will be using a Deep Learning model; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
